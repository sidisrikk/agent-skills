# To Tasks

Break a plan into independently-grabbable tasks using vertical slices (tracer bullets).

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Work from whatever is already in the conversation context. If the user refers to a local PRD or design doc, read it first.

### 2. Explore the codebase (optional)

If you have not already explored the codebase, do so to understand the current state of the code.

### 3. Draft vertical slices

Break the plan into **tracer bullet** tasks. Each task is a thin vertical slice that cuts through ALL integration layers end-to-end, NOT a horizontal slice of one layer.

Slices may be 'HITL' or 'AFK'. HITL slices require human interaction, such as an architectural decision or a design review. AFK slices can be implemented and merged without human interaction. Prefer AFK over HITL where possible.

<vertical-slice-rules>
- Each slice delivers a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer (schema, API, UI, tests)
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own
- Prefer many thin slices over few thick ones
</vertical-slice-rules>

### 4. Quiz the user

Present the proposed breakdown as a numbered list. For each slice, show:

- **Title**: short descriptive name
- **Type**: HITL / AFK
- **Blocked by**: which other tasks (if any) must complete first
- **User stories covered**: which user stories this addresses (if the source material has them)

Ask the user:

- Does the granularity feel right? (too coarse / too fine)
- Are the dependency relationships correct?
- Should any slices be merged or split further?
- Are the correct slices marked as HITL and AFK?

Iterate until the user approves the breakdown.

### 5. Create the Task files

For each approved slice, save it as a local markdown file in `docs/tasks/`. Use sequential numbering: `0001-slug.md`, `0002-slug.md`, etc. Create the directory if it doesn't exist. Use the template below.

<task-template>
## Parent

[Parent Doc](path/to/prd-or-plan.md) (if applicable)

## What to build

A concise description of this vertical slice. Describe the end-to-end behavior, not layer-by-layer implementation.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Blocked by

- Blocked by [Task Name](000X-slug.md) (if any)

Or "None - can start immediately" if no blockers.
